You are tasked with designing a notification system for a social media platform. Users of the platform can subscribe to receive notifications for various events such as when they receive a new message, when someone likes their post, or when someone comments on their post.
Implement the Observer pattern to allow users to subscribe to different types of notifications and receive updates when those events occur. Ensure that the system is scalable and easy to extend in the future to accommodate new types of notifications.
